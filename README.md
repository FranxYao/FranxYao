### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  |  ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=FranxYao)

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh with professor Mirella Lapata. Previously I finished my M.S. at Columbia University and B.S. at Peking University. My email address is yao.fu@ed.ac.uk

I try to spent my half time on ML and half time on NLP, but I define myself as an NLP person.
